# milestone-one

This is a milestone project for my Software Development Bootcamp Program. 

For this project, I am to create a browser game. I chose to create a trivia game that contains questions about the show "Stranger Things" on Netflix to test you on how well you know the show (from Season 1 to Season 4).

To start the game, click on the "Play Game" button. Answer the questions by clicking an answer. Once you click on an answer, the next question will load until you get to the very end. When you finish all 10 questions, it will direct you to the page where you can submit your score. You can also start over if you want to try again to aim for a better score.

Unfinished functionality: 
Need to add a countdown timer so that when the timer goes to 0, it goes to the next question.
Need to make a new page where it displays the list of scores.
Sometimes, the music does not play in index.html.
